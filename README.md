Weather Api. Images for Clear works. 
Images for Rain works. 
Images for clouds work.
I couldnt find a city it was snowing in so i cant confirm or deny if images for snowy parts displays. (probably not, not even sure if "snowy" is the name i need to pull and reference.
default image DOES NOT load. Not sure why. It should be loaded but i cant find out why it wont. But everything else does. 


I used switch statements for the images to display them and swap as needed.
